Gruta README
============

About
-----

Gruta is a web content management system written in Perl.

Installation
------------

1. Install the Artemus and Grutatxt modules, available from:

	http://triptico.com/software/artemus.html
	http://triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html

If you want to use the DBI source driver, you'll need DBI and a
corresponding DBD, of course. SQLite is fine and probably what
you want.

2. Install this package:

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ su -c "make install"

3. Create the directories under your Apache tree. For example, if you
plan to host the _grutasample_ site and you have Apache files in /var/www,
then run

	# mkdir /var/www/grutasample /var/www/grutasample/img
	# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/grutasample

Change `www-data' to whatever user your Apache runs as.

4. Create a directory where your application data will be stored. The
Apache user needs to write there, so make him the owner. For organization
purposes, it can be under the .../grutasample directory; just ensure
it's not accesible via web by means of an Apache authorization directive.

5. Copy the `g.cgi' file from ./examples.

6. Modify it to suit your needs. You'll have to change the $base variable,
the source driver (choose between DBI or FS) and the `base_url'. If your
data directory is not under $base, change the reference in the Source
object creation accordingly. You'll probably have also to change the
language of your application templates (look for available languages in
/usr/share/gruta/templates/artemus) and the setlocale() call.

7. Touch your Apache configuration. First, make the `g.cgi' program be the
document index, by adding the following to your configuration file:

	DirectoryIndex g.cgi

If your data directory is under the Apache tree, forbid raw access to
it by adding

	<Location /var>
        	order allow,deny
	        deny from all
	</Location>

This will probably be under a virtual host configuration. Use your Apache
knowledge, this is not an Apache manual.

8. Point your browser to the URL. As it's the first time, an `admin' user
with a random password has been created. Click on administration, change
the password, and start configuring from there. Add your new sections,
users and entries. Enjoy.
