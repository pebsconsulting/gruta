Gruta - A web content management system
=======================================

Features and highlights
-----------------------

 - Very lightweight, with as few external dependencies as possible.
 - Optimal to build blogs, portals and other post-oriented web sites.
 - Posts are organized by topics and can be marked with tags.
 - Posts can have a publishing date in the future, so that they
   are automatically published.
 - Posts can include visitor comments. Also, support for Akismet
   or blogspam.net comment SPAM filters is included.
 - Complete RSS support for posts (full, by topic or by tag) or
   for comments.
 - Support for posts available only to logged-in users for a specified
   time, to implement commercial paid-for-content sites.
 - Each topic can include its own set of editors.
 - Includes a command-line tool with full access to the internal
   database, for complex and repetitive operations that can
   benefit from scripting in Unix-like environments.
 - Hit counters can be stored for each post, maintaining an
   automatic list of most read posts.
 - Fast, internal search.
 - No SQL database needed (though you can use one if you want).
 - Not written in PHP (nor Python, nor Ruby...).
 - Used from 2001 in several live sites with moderate traffic, so
   reliability is ensured.
