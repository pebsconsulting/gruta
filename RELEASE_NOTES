Gruta Release Notes
===================

2.0.1
-----

 * On-the-fly Gzip compression (if browser accepts it).
 * New special uris; `abstract', to paste a story's abstract, and `body',
   to paste the full body of another one.
 * A new renderer, Text, for plain text content.
 * New Artemus variables to set HTML metadata; `html_title',
   `html_description' and `html_keywords'.
 * A new supertemplate called CSS, that returns the Cascading Style
   Sheet instead of having it embedded in all output.
 * A new supertemplate called SITEMAP (to be aliased to /sitemap.xml).
 * If a story called `index' is present in a topic, the 'TOPIC' template
   shows its body instead of just the name of the topic.
 * Several new commands in the `gruta' command line tool; _new_story_ (to
   create a new story from STDIN), _import_rss_ (to import an RSS file
   into a topic), _update_story_ (to update a story from STDIN).
 * Internal server errors set the HTTP status to 500.
 * Some old function templates have been deleted and moved to Artemus.
 * Many templates have been simplified with new Artemus keywords.
 * The DBI driver is less verbose on errors.
 * Those templates more prone to be changed when configuring a new
   site have been renamed to have a prefix of 'cfg_'.
 * Added POD documentation to some templates.
 * Date formatting functions now accept `%w' to print the week day
   as a number.
 * New global argument `dummy_touch' to avoid updating the `hits' count
   of each story.
 * Several fixes to the Mbox driver.
 * Don't generate empty 'about' and 'legal' links in 'meta_menu' if
   they don't exist.
