=head2 assert_visible_story

 assert_visible_story {topic_id} {id}

If the specified story is not visible (i.e. its
publication day is in the future, and the logged
in user is not the admin nor the topic editor)
redirects the HTTP query to the C<404> template. As
all _assert_ templates, it does the redirection
aborting further template execution.
