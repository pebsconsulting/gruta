Gruta FAQ
=========

This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about the Gruta web
content management system.

Story formatting
----------------

What is this Grutatxt format?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grutatxt is a special plain text format that is designed to be as intuitive
as possible oriented to web publising. Basicly, just separate paragraphs
with an empty line, mark bold text enclosed in asterisks and italic
enclosed in underscores. URLs are automatically formatted. Headings are
defined by underlining phrases with equal signs, hyphens and tildes.

Grutatxt is a very rich specification that allows even creating visually
appealing lists and tables. Please consult the following two documents:

 * http://triptico.com/docs/grutatxt_markup.html
 * http://triptico.com/docs/grutatxt_markup_source.html

The first one is a demo of all things doable in Grutatxt format and the
second one is how they are written. You'll find it's really easy and
powerful.

What are "pseudo-URLs"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are special character strings that can be inserted in story texts and
be interpreted by Gruta. The format is very similar to URLs (that's the
reason of the naming) and are formed by a special keyword, followed by
the usual :// mark, then by the arguments separated by slashes.

 * story: includes a link to a story. Must be followed by the topic
   and the story id separated by slashes.
 * topic: includes a link to a topic. Must be followed by the topic id.
 * abstract: inserts the abstract of a story into the current one. Same
   as for *story*.
 * body: inserts the full body of a story into the current one. Same as
   for *story*.
 * img: inserts a link to an image. Must be followed by the image file
   name, with an optional alignment (left or right) separated by a slash.
 * thumb: inserts a thumbnail to the image, that can be clicked to be
   seen in full size. Format is the same as for `img'.

If any of the story links fail (i.e. they do not point to an existing
story), an error is inserted instead.

How can I control which portion of each post is listed in the indexes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The piece of a story that is listed in indexes (being the topic page or an
RSS feed) is called the _abstract_ and is by default the text from the top
of the story down to the end of the first paragraph after the title. This
can be changed by introducing a special set of characters, <->
(familiarily called "the UFO"), alone in a line, marking the end of the
abstract (it always starts at the top of the story).

Since version 2.3.2, a new checkbox exists for each story to list its
full content in indexes (so the abstract is the same as the body).

How can I insert a table of contents in a story?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 2.3.1, stories can include an automatically generated table
of contents, built using the story headings. Tables of contents are
inserted after the abstract.

The special character string <?> can be inserted (alone in a line) to
force a TOC creation in ad-hoc places.

User management
---------------

How many user levels exist in Gruta?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three main user levels: those having administrator capabilities
(that can do everything), those that not (but can be set as "editors" for
special topics, see below) and the rest of the world, that visit Gruta
sites without being identified.

How can I give topic maintenance capabilities to specific users?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topics can have what it's called "editors", that is, plain users that have
administrator capabilities on it, meaning that they can add, modify and
delete stories.

To add an editor to a topic, just write its name in the appropriate field
in the topic modification form.

How can I maintain a paid-by-content site with Gruta?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Gruta web CMS includes the following features to implement a
commercial site:

 * Users with an expiration date
 * Posts with a subscriber-only limit date

Only identified users can access subscriber-only articles.

Subscriptions are managed by creating users with an expiration date (as,
for example, using a yearly fee). If the expiration date is over, the user
will no longer be able to login.

If a non-identified user tries to access a post with a subscriber-only
limit date, a special message suggesting him to subscribe will be shown
instead.

After a post's subscriber date is due, the article will be available to
everyone. Consider using a short time for subscriber only article (like a
week or two), because you will benefit from search engines when they'll
become free for everyone.

Contribution
------------

How can I add a new translation to Gruta?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add your own translation to Gruta, please follow these
steps:

 # Create an empty file named `lang_XX', where `XX' is the two-letter
   identifier for the language, on the `templates/art5' directory of a
   Gruta distribution.
 # Execute the command `art5 -l' (this program is part of the _Artemus_
   template toolkit package) there. The new file will be filled with all
   the translateable strings.
 # Fill it with appropriate strings in your language. The format of
   the file should be straightforward.
 # Do a `make install' and the new language will be available for
   selection.

If you do that, please send your file to mailto:angel@triptico.com (me)
to add it to the main Gruta distribution.
