Gruta INSTALL
=============

1. Install the Artemus and Grutatxt modules, available from:

 	http://triptico.com/software/artemus.html
 	http://triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html

If you want to use the DBI source driver, you'll need DBI and a
corresponding DBD, of course. SQLite is fine and probably what
you want.

2. Install this package:

 	$ perl Makefile.PL
 	$ make
 	$ su -c "make install"

3. Create the directories under your Apache tree. For example, if you
plan to host the _grutasample_ site and you have Apache files in /var/www,
then run

 	# mkdir /var/www/grutasample /var/www/grutasample/img
 	# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/grutasample

Change `www-data' to whatever user your Apache runs as.

4. Create a directory where your application data will be stored. The
Apache user needs to write there, so make him the owner. For organization
purposes, it can be under the .../grutasample directory; just ensure
it's not accesible via web by means of an Apache authorization directive
(see below).

5. Copy the `g.cgi' file from the `examples' subdirectory in the
distribution source.

6. Modify it to suit your needs. You'll have to change the $base variable,
the source driver (choose between DBI or FS) and the `base_url'. If your
data directory is not under $base, change the reference in the Source
object creation accordingly. You'll probably also have to change the
language of your application templates (look for available languages in
/usr/share/gruta/templates/artemus) and the setlocale() call.

7. Touch your Apache configuration. First, make the `g.cgi' program be the
document index, by adding the following to your configuration file:

 	DirectoryIndex g.cgi

If your data directory is under the Apache tree, forbid raw access to
it by adding

 	<Location /var>
         	order allow,deny
 	        deny from all
 	</Location>

This will probably be under a virtual host configuration. Use your Apache
knowledge, this is not an Apache manual.

8. Point your browser to the URL. As it's the first time, an `admin' user
with a random password has been created and the program flow redirected
to the administration page. Select the `admin' user from the 'Users' section
and set the password.

9. Create some topics. New topics will appear in the top menu. Clicking on
them will allow you to create new stories. If you create a topic with the
topic id 'info', the stories with ids 'about' and 'legal' will be magically
added to the top header. For the rest of your stories, create another topic.
One with id 'main' will be OK.
